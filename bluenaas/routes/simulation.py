    """
    Run a distributed neuron simulation across multiple instances, either in autosave or real-time mode.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    `org_id : str`
        The organization ID associated with the simulation.
    `project_id : str`
        The project ID associated with the simulation.
    `model_self : str`
        The URI or identifier for the neuron model being simulated.

    `request : StreamSimulationBodyRequest`
        The request body containing the simulation configuration, and optional flags for autosave and real-time streaming.

    The `StreamSimulationBodyRequest` consists of:

        - `config : SingleNeuronSimulationConfig`
            The detailed configuration of the neuron simulation, including current injection parameters, recording locations, etc.
        - `autosave : Optional[bool]`
            Flag to indicate whether the simulation should automatically save the results. Defaults to `False`.
        - `realtime : Optional[bool]`
            Flag to enable real-time streaming of simulation results. Defaults to `False`.


    Returns:
    --------
    StreamingResponseWithCleanup or dict
        If `realtime` is True, the response is a `StreamingResponseWithCleanup` that streams simulation state to the client.
        If `autosave` is True, the response is a dictionary with simulation job details and resources.

    Raises:
    -------
    BlueNaasError
        Raised if there is an internal error during the simulation process.
    Exception
        Raised if there is an issue while streaming simulation data.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The function handles current-varying and frequency-varying simulations.
    - Tasks are distributed as individual simulation instances.
    - The simulation results are either streamed in real time or saved based on the `realtime` and `autosave` flags.
    - If `realtime` is enabled, streaming response is generated to update clients continuously about the state of the simulation.
        and if autosave is enabled too then result will be saved at the end of the simulation at the celery task definition
    - If `autosave` is enabled, the simulation state and results are stored and accessible later through Nexus queries.

    Workflow:
    ---------
    1. Prepare simulation resources if `autosave` is enabled.
    2. Pre-process the simulation, calculating synapses and building the model.
    3. Depending on the simulation type (current or frequency varying), generate tasks for simulation instances.
    4. Group and run tasks asynchronously using Celery's `group`.
    5. If `realtime`, stream the simulation results to the client.
    6. If `autosave`, return a job ID and resources for querying simulation status and results later.
