# BlueNaaS-SingleCell

Blue-Neuroscience-as-a-Service-SingleCell is an open source web application.
It enables users to quickly visualize single cell model morphologies in 3D
or as a dendrogram. Using a simple web user interface, single cell simulations
can be easily configured and launched, producing voltage traces from selected
compartments.

## Examples

You can use the application on the EBRAINS platform at https://ebrains-cls-interactive.github.io/online-use-cases.html by selecting "Single Cell InSilico Experiments". You can also follow this [direct link](https://blue-naas-bsp-epfl.apps.hbp.eu/#/url/hippocampus_optimization/rat/CA1/v4.0.5/optimizations_Python3/CA1_pyr_cACpyr_mpg141208_B_idA_20190328144006/CA1_pyr_cACpyr_mpg141208_B_idA_20190328144006.zip?use_cell=cell_seed3_0.hoc&bluenaas=true).

## Documentation

The user documentation for the service can be found [here](https://ebrains-cls-interactive.github.io/docs/online_usecases/single_cell_in_silico/single_cell_clamp/single_cell_clamp.html).

From version 2.0 we are using [BlueCelluLab](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BlueCelluLab) library to run simulations.

To get the code for legacy (neuron) version check out [v1 branch](https://bbpgitlab.epfl.ch/project/sbo/bluenaas-single-cell/-/tree/v1)

## Development

1. After cloning or forking the repository, you can use UV to install the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. To start the backend server run the following command. This starts some docker services and then brings up the fastapi server:

## Run dev frontend/backend

```bash
make build
```

## Simulate your own models.

You can upload your own models and run single cell simulations. The `.zip` file format must be:
model_name.zip

- model_name
  - mechanisms /
    - \*.mod files
  - morphology /
    - morphology file loaded by cell.hoc
  - cell.hoc
